# Dylanbot Multipurpose Discord Selfbot
Dylanbot is a selfbot multitool project developed and maintained solely by me, Dylan. 

Before anything else, mind you, that I am not particularly skilled in making a bot out of complete scratch. 

This project is more likely going to turn out as a collection of tools made by other people. My main contribution in this project would be of course to make a systematic, properly working multitool selfbot for discord, with a few changes made unto other people's projects if necessary. I could probably even add in my own commands if I gain enough knowledge of python.

I will be giving credit to exactly where I got the tools that I put into this multitool project to give respects to their original work and idea.

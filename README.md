# Dylanbot Multitool Selfbot
This is a bot project for Discord, developed and maintained solely by me, Dylan.

Mind you that I am not particularly skilled in making bots from scratch.

This project is mainly a compilation of useful tools. I'm going to make it work better by compiling them in one systematic selfbot and make sure all of them are working properly and are easy and ready to use.

I will be giving credit to projects that I got inspiration from below
